It's been 10 days since we closed our [call for paper](/blog/posts/last-days-for-c4p/) and our [organizing team](/team) worked really hard to prepare the final DevFest Agenda.

We really want to **thank** all of **you for** your submissions! We received **more than 40 proposals**. This is an incredible result for our community that is organizing this conference for the first time.

The [final agenda](/schedule) will land üõ¨ later this week. But now, we are able to share other **five awesome speakers** that are approaching our DevFest Pisa 0.1. We are so happy to talk about **#ai**, **#machinelearning**, **#python**, **#voiceui** and **#golang** with:

* [Alfredo Morresi](/speakers/10/) (Google) - [Exploring Google Assistant and DialogFlow](/schedule/day1?sessionId=154)
* [Francesco Romano](/speakers/7/) (GDG Cosenza) - [I robot guidano meglio di noi?](/schedule/day1?sessionId=151)
* [Federico Paolinelli](/speakers/8/) (List Group) - [Go for C developers: a journey into learning golang from a C developer perspective](/schedule/day1?sessionId=152)

**We are SOLD OUT!**

We are extremely excited to share this result with all of you! We **finished all the tickets** we had on Eventbrite nearly 10 days before the event üéâ

This is an incredible result for our community, and we want to thank all of you for sharing our events with your friends and colleagues. We are really looking forward to meeting all of you at our DevFest Pisa 0.1!

Moreover, we totally understand your concerns if you haven't managed to get a ticket üò•. For this reason, we decided to **open our waiting list**. We are looking for new spots to fit everyone. We will reach you back as soon as we find new spots.

On the other hand, if you got your ticket and **you can't attend the conference** (we are extremely sad to hear so...), we kindly ask you to **cancel your order** on Eventbrite. You will free-up a spot for someone else and we will prevent wasting of food/drinks, etc.

## Join the waiting list!

To Join the waiting list you can simply do it on **Eventbrite**. If you haven't registered yet and you plan to attend, please do it soon! We will give new tickets on a **first come, first serve** basis.
